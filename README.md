# Secondary Auth Skip

Mainly for Korean players

When you log in and use your secondary auth password the first time with the module, it will save the data from it to a JSON file `code.json` and will be used on next login making it so you never need to manually put in your secondary auth code again


If for some reason this module breaks, open the code.json file with any text editor and replace all of it with a single `0`, alternatively you can redownload the code.json from here and replace it
